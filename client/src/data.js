      'China, the worlds most populous nation, is a vast and diverse country in East Asia. Renowned for its rich history spanning thousands of years, China has made significant contributions to art, science, philosophy, and technology. It boasts a diverse landscape encompassing towering mountains, expansive deserts, ancient cities, and lush river valleys like the Yangtze and Yellow River. China is the first country I traveled to outside of the US and Mexico. I went there for a Study Abroad trip where I studied social entrepreneurship. During my one month stay, I was able to visit the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Zhangjiajie. In China I was able to see the Great Wall of China, the Summer Palace, and the famous floating mountains in Zhangjiajie National Forest.     ',
